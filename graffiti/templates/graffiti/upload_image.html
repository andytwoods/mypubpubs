        <p class="">Once you have added a URL, please follow instruction in StencilAR to download that URL to your
            headset. The software will then be able to download your image.
            One way of creating a URL for your image is to upload it to dropbox and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://help.dropbox.com/share/create-and-share-link">ask dropbox to generate a
                URL</a>. By saving over the same image in dropbox, you can get StencilAR to download each change, without needing to return here!</p>
